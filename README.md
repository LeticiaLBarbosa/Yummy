# Yummy
Cooking a meal is not always the simplest or the most objective activity to perform,there are several factors that can make this usually pleasant time, frustrating. Sometimes
we want to make a special meal for a specific occasion, other times we know wonderfuldishes, but we do not know how to replicate them in a larger scale and making a shopping
list can become a much more complicated and time-consuming task than it should.Considering these and some other scenarios, we propose a solution to this so
recurring and frequent problem: Yummy. Yummy is nothing more than a recipe catalogwith some additional features that can assist both in the process of executing a recipe as in all stages of its planning.
With Yummy users can search for recipes, save them locally, classify them in categories such as snacks, dinner, dessert, and starter. When selecting a recipe, it is
possible to indicate the number of portions desired so that the quantities of the ingredients will be adapted according to the number of servings and, if desired, the user can also select a set of recipes and generate a shopping list with enough ingredients to cook all of these recipes in an optimized way and avoiding waste. The user can also add the items and quantities available at home, so only what is needed is printed on the shopping list. Another quite common scenario which our system also brings significant help is
when the user already has several ingredients but does not know what to do with them.
In this case, he can insert the items in the system, and it will indicate which recipe options can be made, also suggesting some other options with items that can be purchased
separately if the user wishes to go out and buy only what would be missing.
